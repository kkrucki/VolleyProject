Project summary
This project was sent by Volley as an assignemnt for their Senior Computer Vision Engineer Role. 
It involves tracking a tennis ball across a board split into four regions. 
The main file in this repo reads in a video, finds a ball, calculates its center, determines what board region it is in, and saves an output video. 

Usage
The solution presented will only work on other videos if those video are taken under the same lighting condtions with a similar colored ball.
